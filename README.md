Yet Another Timer API

This timer API was created as an activity with the purpose of learning the open-source project creational process. It was part of an "Open Source Software" class at UFRGS.

It's just a simple API that creates POSIX per-process timers. The main purpose is schedule an activity for a process after a timer expiration. Timers can be periodic or not.
